## Description

This prework study guide was created to help bootcamp students start the process of learning how to code! It is a place where there are consice and easy to reference notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I built this project to build confidence as I enter a new career and become a student again. The prework study guide gives me a reference point as I begin this new journey into coding. I learned a multidude of things through this project. I built my confidence using GitHub, I gained a deeper understanding of coding languages, and used my attention to detail to problemn solve.
